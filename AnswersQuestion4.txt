1) The scheduler() is in kernel\proc.c
2) It is endlessly iterating over the Procedures array, and take the first one that is in 'runnable'
3) when a new process is created we first find in theק process array, a process with 'UNUSED' status, than we copy the PCB of the parent to the that PCB (exapא the process number, and parent), and change its status to 'runnable'
4) from the user space it been first trap at trap.c->usertrap (probably using ecall) and then its call the appropriate system call which is  define in the kernal space
